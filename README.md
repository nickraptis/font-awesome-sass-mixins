font-awesome-sass-mixins
========================

A variation of the iconic Font-Awesome toolkit that acts as a SASS mixin library.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is a much beloved toolkit for bringing icons to websites.

However, much like bootstrap, it sometimes feels that to harness its full power,
you might end up cramming too many classes on your elements.

This project tries, in a very naive way, to mitigate that.
It transforms all of Font-Awesome's style classes into SASS mixins
that you can use to define your own complex styles.
As a bonus, you can generate as little as you need in your CSS file.
